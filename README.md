# how to run application 


         ----------- PROJECT ONE : WITH DATA BASE -----folder:with_data_base-----
          how the project works ---> the cv is converted to json 
          then json object is saved into a file 
          when the front application is launched it check if the database containes information 
          if the answer is no , the the JSON file will be saved in data base via post request
          after that all operation (research restaurant) will be handled via get request to the database 
          i also used redux to make data manipulation easy


          
          ----------- PROJECT TWO : NO DATA BASE -----folder:sipmle-----
          how the project works ---> the cv is converted to json 
          then json object is saved into a file 
          the front end get the reads the json file via axios 
          and then save it in a reducer
          all operation are based on the reducer and the cvs and json file
